        <p id="JavaScript_and_Java" >JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a
        host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
        programmatic control over them.
        
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
        such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
        supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
        <p>
        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
        (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user
        events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For
        example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
        from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
        </p>

        <h3>Java and Javascript</h3>

        <p id="javascript">
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language
            resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression
            syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
            JavaScript.</p>
            <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based
            on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based
            object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
            inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
            special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
            
            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
            methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to
            implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
        </p>
        </div>
        
            <h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>
            <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
            to certain rules.</p>
            <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be
            digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the
            characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences
            as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
